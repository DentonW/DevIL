README.win is more relevant in this release.

CMAKE files are included, but they need to be updated.
This is the only way to create VC6 and VC2003 projects.


......


Installation
------------

Edit config.h to tell DevIL what external libraries you are using.

Then go to Tools - Options - Directories to add in the include and lib
directories for DevIL.

All MSVC++ project files are in the projects/msvc or projects/msvc8 folders.



Usage
-----

When compiling a program that uses DevIL*, it must be configured to use the
multithreaded dll version of the libc runtime.  To do this, go to Project
Settings - C/C++ tab - Change "Category" to 'Code Generation' - Change
"Use run-time library" to 'Multithreaded DLL' or 'Debug Multithreaded DLL',
based on whether the project you are build is release or debug, respectively.

For more information, look at the tutorials.
